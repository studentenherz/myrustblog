### Tech stack

This is a blog webapp built a a Rust fullstack. The backend is made with [Actix Web](https://actix.rs/) and the frontend with [Yew](https://yew.rs). I'm also using [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/) as the main database.

I've also used other libraries (crates) like [pulldown-cmark](https://github.com/pulldown-cmark/pulldown-cmark/) for Markdown to HTML parsing.

### Roadmap

I made this mostly to learn Rust (by doing), but I also want this to become something worth using. With that in mind, I'll be adding new features and refactoring the code to fix issues, enhance the code style and make de app more performant.

### Want to contribute?

Of course! Just contact me via Telegram [@michelromero](https://t.me/michelromero) or open an issue in the GitHub [repo](https://github.com/studentenherz/myrustblog).
